# TODO

- Add rclone-like CLI interface for multiple difference major options, i.e. `hasher {option}` with these options:
  - `hash`
    - Identical functionality to now
  - `validate`
    - Read from the database and check the files at the path
    - Output conflicts as json to console? Unsure what will be the best way to notify about this
  - `copy`
    - Copy files from source to destination, hash along the way
    - Have option to store source path instead of destination path
- Config and usage changes
  - Move `--use-wal` to config.toml under the database section, default to on
  - Add a general section to config.toml, move these in there:
    - Breadth first
    - Others TBD
  - Make it so no config.toml is required to use all default settings according to the repo's config.toml
- Remove json out
  - Add json-formatted stdout output instead
    - Make sure verbose output lines aren't a problem
- Add a lockfile for directories currently being hashed
  - Ensuring 2 instances of hasher don't hash the same major directory, don't worry about lower directories
  - Make sure there's both linux and windows support
- EVENTUALLY add XOFs
  - Difficult because no simple digest interface thing that allows pasting in of functions like before
- Create actual documentation, rustdocs and expand companion md files
- Add tests
- Add CI integration for tests and codestyle
- Add postgresql support?
